## Biodiversity in National Parks

This project is aimed at analyzing and exploring the wildlife data of different national parks in the United States. The project contains data on the observations of different species of plants and animals in various national parks across the country. The data is analyzed using Python and various data analysis libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### Data Sources

The data used in this project is obtained from two different sources:

1)    Observations data: This data contains information on the observations of different species of plants and animals in various national parks. It includes the scientific name of the species, the name of the park, and the number of observations.
2)    Species data: This data contains information on different species of plants and animals found in various national parks. It includes the scientific name of the species, common names, conservation status, and category (Amphibian, Bird, Fish, Mammal, Nonvascular Plant, Reptile, or Vascular Plant).

### Files

This project contains the following files:
- observations.csv: This file contains the observations data.
- species_info.csv: This file contains the species data.
- observations.ipynb: This is a Jupyter notebook that contains the data analysis and visualization code.
- README.md: This file.

### Data Analysis

The data analysis is performed using Python and various data analysis libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The analysis includes the following:
1) Exploring the species data and identifying the number of species in each category and their conservation status.
2) Analyzing the observations data to identify the species that are most prevalent in each park.
3) Analyzing the observations data to identify the trends in the observations of the Gray Wolf species in different national parks.

### Conclusion

This project aims to explore and analyze the wildlife data of different national parks in the United States. The analysis provides insights into the prevalence of different species of plants and animals in various parks and their conservation status. The analysis can be useful for wildlife management and conservation efforts in national parks.
